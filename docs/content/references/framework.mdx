title: MySo Framework
description: The MySo framework libraries include Move modules that provide the logic for MySo and its standards. A Rust process creates the documentation for the modules directly from comments in the code.
keywords: [ myso framework, myso libraries, move modules, myso standards, rust, documentation from modules, generate framework documentation, crate documentation, build documentation locally, build docs ]
---

The documentation in this section is created from the Rust `cargo doc` process. The process builds the content from comments in the source code.

## Framework documentation

The child pages to this topic describe the module members for the following libraries:

- <UnsafeLink href="/references/framework/myso_bridge">`bridge`</UnsafeLink>
- <UnsafeLink href="/references/framework/myso_std">`std`</UnsafeLink>
- <UnsafeLink href="/references/framework/myso_sui">`myso`</UnsafeLink>
- <UnsafeLink href="/references/framework/myso_myso_system">`myso_system`</UnsafeLink>

## Source code

You can find the source code for these Move modules in the [crates/myso-framework/packages](https://github.com/the-social-proof-foundation/myso-core/tree/main/crates/myso-framework/packages) directory in the `myso` repository on GitHub. As previously mentioned, the comments included in the code provide context for the logic defined.

## Crate documentation

You can review the raw `cargo doc` output of the following documentation in the `myso` repository. The .md files are located in the `crates/myso-framework/docs` directory. Online, they are located at https://github.com/the-social-proof-foundation/myso-core/tree/main/crates/myso-framework/docs.

## Build documentation locally

The most recent documentation is always available in the `main` branch of the `myso` repository. You shouldn't need to build the documentation locally, but if the need arises you can:

1. Open a terminal or console to the `myso/crates/myso-framework` directory.
1. Run `cargo doc --workspace --exclude "myso-benchmark" --no-deps`.
1. The docs are built to `crates/myso-framework/docs` into their respective subdirectories.

:::info

If the `cargo doc` process does not work as expected, try running `cargo clean` before attempting again.
