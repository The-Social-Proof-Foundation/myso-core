MySo provides a command line interface (CLI) tool to interact with the MySo network, its features, and the Move programming language. The complete suite of tools is called the MySo CLI, with commands grouped together by feature. Each group of commands is commonly referred to by its top-level command: MySo Client CLI, MySo Keytool CLI, MySo Move CLI, and MySo Validator CLI.

## Update CLI

The recommended way to manage MySo CLI installations and versions is via `suiup`: https://github.com/mystenLabs/suiup.

The `tracing` feature is important as it adds Move test coverage and debugger support in the MySo CLI. Unless it is enabled you will not be able to use these two features.
