First, install `suiup`:

```sh
$ curl -sSfL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mystenlabs/suiup/main/install.sh \
  | sh
```

Then, installMySo:

```sh
$ suiup install myso@testnet
```

For alternative installation methods, refer to the [`suiup` repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup).

Installing MySo with `suiup` does not configure the client. To use `myso` commands, you must [configure the MySo client](/guides/developer/getting-started/configure-myso-client.mdx).

To confirm that MySo installed correctly:

1. Open a terminal or console
2. Type `myso --version` and press Enter

If you receive a "command not found" error, verify the MySo binaries directory is in your `PATH` environment variable.
