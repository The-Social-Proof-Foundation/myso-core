## Check MySo CLI installation

Before you can use the MySo CLI, you must install it. To check if the CLI exists on your system, open a terminal or console and type the following command:

```sh
$ myso --version
```

If the terminal or console responds with a version number, you already have the MySo CLI installed.

If the command is not found, follow the instructions in [InstallMySo](/guides/developer/getting-started/myso-install.mdx) to get the MySo CLI on your system.
