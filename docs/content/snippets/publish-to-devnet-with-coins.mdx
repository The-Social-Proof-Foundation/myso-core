Before being able to publish your package to Testnet, you need Testnet MYSO tokens. To get some, visit the online faucet at https://faucet.mysocial.network/. For other ways to get MYSO in your Testnet account, see [Get MYSO Tokens](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins).

Now that you have an account with some Testnet MYSO, you can deploy your contracts. To publish your package, use the following command in the same terminal or console:

```
myso client publish --gas-budget <GAS-BUDGET>
```

For the gas budget, use a standard value such as `20000000`.
