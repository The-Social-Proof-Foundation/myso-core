title: Bridging Tokens
description: Moving tokens from one blockchain to another is called bridging. To bridge tokens from another blockchain toMySo, you can use the MySo Bridge, Wormhole Connect, Wormhole Portal Bridge, or ZetaChain.

Bridging is the process of moving tokens from one blockchain to another. When you use a bridge to move tokens between incompatible blockchains, the tokens are wrapped and converted to a derivative token for the target blockchain. You can transfer tokens from other blockchains toMySo, or transfer MYSO tokens to other blockchains.

MySo supports bridging through MySo Bridge, Wormhole Connect, Wormhole Portal Bridge, and ZetaChain. Each bridge offers different features and capabilities to suit various use cases.

## MySo Bridge

MySo Bridge is the native bridge for the MySo network, built into the core architecture. It provides optimal integration and operation, enabling the movement of digital assets between MySo and other blockchains while preserving security and maintaining interoperability. MySo Bridge supports secure and efficient transfer of native and wrapped ETH to and fromMySo, leveragingMySo's capabilities to offer fast transactions, lower costs, and a decentralized architecture.

Bridge tokens at [bridge.mysocial.network](https://bridge.mysocial.network/).

### Operation and governance

MySo Bridge is operated and governed by MySo validators, the same set that secures the MySo network. Bridge transfers and other actions require validator signatures with a threshold of voting power. Governance is handled by validator voting.

To learn how to set up a MySo Bridge full node, see [MySo Bridge Validator Node Configuration](../../guides/operator/bridge-node-configuration.mdx).

### Supported assets

MySo Bridge supports bridging between MySo and other networks with the following assets:

| Asset | Description |

### Global limiter {#global-limiter}

A limiter protects funds by constraining the total value of assets leaving MySo Bridge in a 24-hour window. It tracks value hourly and aggregates from the last 24 hours, refreshing every hour. The limit applies globally and varies by direction (Ethereum → MySo versus MySo → Ethereum). It also caps the maximum single transfer.

Limits are set by validator committee vote and announced in the [mn-validator-announcements channel](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1093852827627040768) on Discord. The global limit is currently $16 million from Ethereum to MySo and $7 million from MySo to Ethereum per 24 hours.

### Asset pricing

MySo Bridge v1 uses static pricing to calculate limits. ETH is priced at $2,600. One ETH consumes $2,600 of the limit. The validator committee governs pricing through voting.

### Minimum and maximum transfers

There is no minimum transfer, but very small fractions can be rounded down. For ETH and WETH, reduced precision of eight decimals rounds 10.0000000000000001 down to 10.

| Token | Minimal value | 
| --- | --- |
| ETH | 0.00000001 ETH |
| WETH | 0.00000001 ETH |

The maximum transfer equals the global USD limit. See [Global limiter](#global-limiter).

## Wormhole Connect {#wormhole-connect}

Wormhole Connect lets you bridge tokens from any supported Wormhole chain intoMySo, with an extra drop of MYSO for gas fees. Developers can also embed Connect in their own websites and apps.

:::tip

See [Cross-Chain Token Transfers with Wormhole Connect](https://wormhole.com/docs/tutorials/messaging/myso-connect/) on the Wormhole website for a tutorial.

:::

### Supported assets

Wormhole Connect supports lock-and-mint bridging for ETH, WETH, USDC, MATIC, WMATIC, BNB, WBNB, AVAX, WAVAX, FTM, WFTM, CELO, GLMR, WGLRM, and SOL across Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Celo, Moonbeam, Solana, and MySo. Bridged tokens are received as Wormhole-minted tokens on the destination chain. See the [Wormhole token list](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-token-list). Some tokens support swapping on destination DEXs.

### Features

**Automatic relay**: On EVM chains andMySo, Wormhole Connect can pay destination-chain gas automatically. Users only pay gas on the source chain.

**Gas drop-off**: Users can pay an extra fee on the source chain to receive a small amount of native gas on the destination chain. For example, bridging USDC from Ethereum to MySo can include a fee in USDC to receive MYSO for gas. This feature is supported on EVM chains and MySo.

See the [Wormhole FAQ](https://wormhole.com/docs/products/connect/overview/) for details.

## Wormhole Portal Bridge

The [Portal Bridge](https://www.portalbridge.com/myso), powered by Wormhole, supports bridging assets from any of the [22 supported Wormhole chains](https://www.wormhole.com/network).

## ZetaChain {#zetachain}

[ZetaChain](https://www.zetachain.com/) enables omnichain smart contracts and cross-chain messaging between MySo and other blockchains. The ZetaChain protocol supports bridging digital assets and sending arbitrary messages across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, and other major chains.

### Supported assets

ZetaChain supports native cross-chain transfers for tokens such as:

- **Bitcoin (BTC)**: Native Bitcoin transfers through HTLC

- **Ethereum (ETH)**: Native ETH and ERC-20 tokens including USDC, USDT, WBTC

- **Polygon (MATIC)**: Native MATIC and Polygon tokens

- **BSC (BNB)**: Native BNB and BEP-20 tokens

- **Avalanche (AVAX)**: Native AVAX and Avalanche C-Chain tokens

- **Layer 2 chains**: Arbitrum, Optimism, Base

Assets bridged through ZetaChain are represented as ZRC-20 tokens on the ZetaChain network and can be transferred to any connected chain.

See the [ZetaChain supported networks](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/chains/list) for the complete list.

### Omnichain messaging

Beyond asset transfers, ZetaChain's Universal App framework enables smart contracts to communicate across all connected chains. Developers can build applications that:

- Call functions on contracts across multiple blockchains.

- Read and write state across chains through ZetaChain's validators.

- Execute complex multi-chain workflows in a single transaction.

### How it works

ZetaChain uses a proof-of-stake validator network to observe transactions on external chains and relay messages between them. When you initiate a cross-chain transaction:

1. You interact with a gateway contract on the source chain (MySo or any supported chain).

1. ZetaChain validators observe and verify the transaction.

1. The validators execute any omnichain contract logic on ZetaChain.

1. The validators trigger the corresponding action on the destination chain.

All cross-chain operations are handled automatically without manual intervention.

### Gas handling

ZetaChain provides flexible gas payment options:

- **Pay on source chain**: Pay all fees upfront on the source chain in ZETA, USDC, or USDT.

- **Automatic gas drop**: Receive native tokens on the destination chain for transaction fees.

- **Custom gas logic**: Implement application-specific gas payment models.

### Gateway contracts

Interact with ZetaChain through gateway contracts deployed on each supported chain:

**Athens Testnet**

- Sepolia (Ethereum): `0x0c487a766110c85d301d96e33579c5b317fa4995`

- Base Sepolia: `0x0c487a766110c85d301d96e33579c5b317fa4995`

- Amoy (Polygon): `0x0c487a766110c85d301d96e33579c5b317fa4995`

- BSC Testnet: `0x0c487a766110c85d301d96e33579c5b317fa4995`

Always verify gateway addresses from the [official ZetaChain documentation](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/reference/network/contracts) before integrating.
