As a validator onMySo, there are some processes you need to perform to ensure your nodes are always optimized.

## Storage management

All `myso-node` related data is stored by default under `/opt/myso/db/`. This is specified in the `myso-node` configuration file.

```sh
$ cat /opt/myso/config/validator.yaml | grep db-path
```

```
  db-path: /opt/myso/db/authorities_db
  db-path: /opt/myso/db/consensus_db
```

Ensure that you have an appropriately sized disk mounted for the database to write to.

- To check the size of the local `myso-node` databases:

```sh
$ du -sh /opt/myso/db/
$ du -sh /opt/myso/db/authorities_db
$ du -sh /opt/myso/db/consensus_db
```

- To delete the local `myso-node` databases:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop myso-node
$ sudo rm -rf /opt/myso/db/authorities_db /opt/myso/db/consensus_db
```

## Key management

The following keys are used by `myso-node`:

| Key          | Scheme   | Purpose                         |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `protocol.key` | bls12381 | Transactions                    |
| `account.key`  | ed25519  | Controls assets for staking     |
| `network.key`  | ed25519  | State sync                      |
| `worker.key`   | ed25519  | Consensus (to be migrated)      |

These are configured in the [`myso-node` configuration file](./validator-config.mdx).

## Metrics

`myso-node` exposes metrics via a local HTTP interface. These can be scraped for use in a central monitoring system, as well as viewed directly from the node.

- View all metrics:

```sh
$ curl -s http://localhost:9184/metrics
```

- Search for a particular metric:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:9184/metrics | grep <METRIC>
```

`myso-node` also pushes metrics to a central MySo metrics proxy.

## Logs

Logs are controlled using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.

The `RUST_LOG_JSON=1` environment variable can optionally be set to enable logging in JSON structured format.

Depending on your deployment method, these are configured in the following places:

- [Ansible](https://github.com/the-social-proof-foundation/myso-core/blob/main/nre/ansible/roles/myso-node/files/myso-node.service)
- [Native systemd](https://github.com/the-social-proof-foundation/myso-core/blob/main/nre/systemd/myso-node.service)
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/the-social-proof-foundation/myso-core/blob/main/nre/docker/docker-compose.yaml)

To view and follow the `myso-node` logs:

```sh
$ journalctl -u myso-node -f
```

To search for a particular match:

```sh
$ journalctl -u myso-node -g <SEARCH_TERM>
```

- If you are using Docker Compose, look at the [examples in the README](https://github.com/the-social-proof-foundation/myso-core/blob/main/nre/docker/README.md#logs).

It is possible to change the logging configuration while a node is running using the admin interface.

To view the currently configured logging values:

```sh
$ curl localhost:1337/logging
```

To change the currently configured logging values:

```sh
$ curl localhost:1337/logging -d "info"
```

## Dashboards

Public dashboard for network-wide visibility:

- [MySo Testnet Validators](https://metrics.mysocial.network/public-dashboards/9b841d63c9bf43fe8acec4f0fa991f5e)

## Software updates

When an update is required to the `myso-node` software, the following process can be used. Follow the relevant Systemd or Docker Compose run book depending on your deployment type. It is highly unlikely that you want to restart with a clean database.

- [Systemd](https://github.com/the-social-proof-foundation/myso-core/blob/main/nre/systemd/README.md#updates)
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/the-social-proof-foundation/myso-core/blob/main/nre/docker/README.md#updates)

## State sync

Checkpoints in MySo contain the permanent history of the network. They are comparable to blocks in other blockchains with one big difference being that they are lagging instead of leading. All transactions are final and executed prior to being included in a checkpoint.

These checkpoints are synchronized between validators and full nodes via a dedicated peer-to-peer state sync interface.

Inter-validator state sync is always permitted, however there are controls available to limit what full nodes are allowed to sync from a specific validator.

The default and recommended `max-concurrent-connections: 0` configuration does not affect inter-validator state sync, but restricts all full nodes from syncing. The [`myso-node` configuration](./validator-config.mdx) can be modified to allow a known full node to sync from a validator:

```sh
p2p-config:
  anemo-config:
    max-concurrent-connections: 0
  seed-peers:
    - address: <multiaddr>  # The p2p address of the full node
      peer-id: <peer-id>    # hex encoded network public key of the node
    - address: ...          # another permitted peer
      peer-id: ...
```

## Chain operations

The following chain operations are executed using the `myso` CLI. This binary is built and provided as a release similar to `myso-node`, for example:

```sh
$ wget https://releases.mysocial.network/$MYSO_SHA/myso
$ chmod +x myso
```

```sh
$ curl https://releases.mysocial.network/$MYSO_SHA/myso -o myso
$ chmod +x myso
```

It is recommended and often required that the `myso` binary release/version matches that of the deployed network.

### Updating on-chain metadata

You can leverage the [validator tool](https://github.com/the-social-proof-foundation/myso-core/blob/main/nre/validator_tool.md) to perform a majority of the following tasks.

An active/pending validator can update its on-chain metadata by submitting a transaction. Some metadata changes take effect immediately, including:

- Name
- Description
- Image URL
- Project URL

Other metadata (keys, addresses, and so on) only come into effect at the next epoch.

To update metadata, a validator makes a `MoveCall` transaction that interacts with the system object. For example:

1. To update `name` to `new_validator_name`, use the MySo Client CLI to call `myso_system::update_validator_name`:

<ImportContent source="info-gas-budget.mdx" mode="snippet" />

```sh
$ myso client call --package 0x3 --module myso_system --function update_validator_name --args 0x5 \"new_validator_name\" --gas-budget 10000
```

2. To update the p2p address starting from next epoch to `/ip4/192.168.1.1`, use the MySo Client CLI to call `myso_system::update_validator_next_epoch_p2p_address`:

```sh
$ myso client call --package 0x3 --module myso_system --function update_validator_next_epoch_p2p_address --args 0x5 "[4, 192, 168, 1, 1]" --gas-budget 10000
```

See the [full list of metadata update functions](https://github.com/the-social-proof-foundation/myso-core/blob/main/crates/myso-framework/packages/myso-system/sources/myso_system.move#L267-L444).

### Operation Cap

To avoid touching account keys too often and allowing them to be stored off-line, validators can delegate the operation ability to another address. This address can then update the reference gas price and tallying rule on behalf of the validator.

Upon creating a validator, a `UnverifiedValidatorOperationCap` is created and transferred to the validator address. The holder of this `Cap` object (short for "Capability") therefore could perform operational actions for this validator. To authorize another address to conduct these operations, a validator transfers the object to another address that they control. 

The transfer can be done by using MySo Client CLI: `myso client transfer`.

To rotate the delegatee address or revoke the authorization, the current holder of `Cap` transfers it to another address. In the event of compromised or lost keys, the validator could create a new `Cap` object to invalidate the incumbent one. 

This is done by calling `myso_system::rotate_operation_cap`:

```sh
$ myso client call --package 0x3 --module myso_system --function rotate_operation_cap --args 0x5 --gas-budget 10000
```

By default, the new `Cap` object is transferred to the validator address, which then could be transferred to the new delegatee address. At this point, the old `Cap` becomes invalidated and no longer represents eligibility.

To get the current valid `Cap` object's ID of a validator, use the MySo Client CLI `myso client objects` command after setting the holder as the active address.

### Updating the gas price survey quote

To update the gas price survey quote of a validator, which is used to calculate the reference gas price at the end of the epoch, the sender needs to hold a valid [`UnverifiedValidatorOperationCap`](#operation-cap). The sender could be the validator itself or a trusted delegatee. 

To do so, call `myso_system::request_set_gas_price`:

```sh
$ myso client call --package 0x3 --module myso_system --function request_set_gas_price --args 0x5 {cap_object_id} {new_gas_price} --gas-budget 10000
```

### Reporting/un-reporting validators

To report a validator or undo an existing report, the sender needs to hold a valid [`UnverifiedValidatorOperationCap`](#operation-cap). The sender could be the validator itself or a trusted delegatee. 

To do so, call `myso_system::report_validator/undo_report_validator`:

```sh
$ myso client call --package 0x3 --module myso_system --function report_validator/undo_report_validator --args 0x5 {cap_object_id} {reportee_address} --gas-budget 10000
```

After a validator is reported by `2f + 1` other validators by voting power, their staking rewards are slashed.

### Joining the validator set

For a MySo address to join the validator set, they need to first sign up as a validator candidate by calling `myso_system::request_add_validator_candidate` with their metadata and initial configs:

```sh
$ myso client call --package 0x3 --module myso_system --function request_add_validator_candidate --args 0x5 {protocol_pubkey_bytes} {network_pubkey_bytes} {worker_pubkey_bytes} {proof_of_possession} {name} {description} {image_url} {project_url} {net_address} {p2p_address} {primary_address} {worker_address} {gas_price} {commission_rate} --gas-budget 10000
```

After an address becomes a validator candidate, any address (including the candidate address itself) can start staking with the candidate's staking pool. After a candidate's staking pool has accumulated at least `myso_system::MIN_VALIDATOR_JOINING_STAKE` amount of stake, the candidate can call `myso_system::request_add_validator` to officially add themselves to next epoch's active validator set:

```sh
$ myso client call --package 0x3 --module myso_system --function request_add_validator --args 0x5 --gas-budget 10000000
```

### Leaving the validator set

To leave the validator set starting next epoch, the sender needs to be an active validator in the current epoch and should call `myso_system::request_remove_validator`:

```sh
$ myso client call --package 0x3 --module myso_system --function request_remove_validator --args 0x5 --gas-budget 10000
```

After the validator is removed at the next epoch change, the staking pool becomes inactive and stakes can only be withdrawn from an inactive pool.

## Private security fixes

There might be instances where urgent security fixes need to be rolled out before publicly announcing its presence (issues affecting liveliness, invariants such as MYSO supply, governance, and so on). To not be actively exploited, Mysten Labs releases signed security binaries incorporating such fixes with a delay in publishing the source code until a large percentage of our validators have patched the vulnerability.

This release process is different and you should expect that announcements of the directory for such binaries are out of band.
[View the public key used to verify these binaries](https://myso-private.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/myso_security_release.pem)

There is also a script available that downloads all the necessary signed binaries and Docker artifacts incorporating the security fixes.

- Usage: `./download_private.sh <directory-name>`

You can also download and verify specific binaries that might not be included by the above script using the `download_and_verify_private_binary.sh` script.

- Usage: `./download_and_verify_private_binary.sh <directory-name> <binary-name>`
