This topic describes how to integrate MYSO, the token native to the MySo network, into a cryptocurrency exchange. The specific requirements and processes to implement an integration vary between exchanges. Rather than provide a step-by-step guide, this topic provides information about the primary tasks necessary to complete an integration. After the guidance about how to configure an integration, you can also find information and code samples related to staking on the MySo network.

## Requirements to configure a MYSO integration

The requirements to configure a MYSO integration include:
 - A MySo full node. You can operate your own MySo full node or use a full node from a node operator.
 - Suggested hardware requirements to run a MySo full node:
    - CPU: 8 physical cores / 16 vCPUs
    - RAM: 128 GB
    - Storage (SSD): 4 TB NVMe drive

For best results, run MySo full nodes on Linux. MySo supports the Ubuntu and Debian distributions. You can also run a full node on macOS.

## Configure a MySo full node

You can set up and configure a [MySo full node](./myso-full-node.mdx) using Docker or directly from source code in the MySo GitHub repository.

## Set up MySo addresses

MySo addresses do not require on-chain initialization, you can spend from an address if it corresponds to your private key. You can derive a 32-byte MySo address by hashing the signature scheme flag byte concatenated with public key bytes `flag || pubkey` using the [BLAKE2b](https://www.blake2.net/) (256 bits output) hashing function.

Currently, MySo address supports these signature schemes: pure Ed25519, Secp256k1, Secp256r1 and multisig. The corresponding flag bytes are 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 respectively.

The following code sample demonstrates how to derive a MySo address in Rust:

```rust
let flag = 0x00; // 0x00 = ED25519, 0x01 = Secp256k1, 0x02 = Secp256r1, 0x03 = multiSig
// Hash the [flag, public key] bytearray using Blake2b
let mut hasher = DefaultHash::default();
hasher.update([flag]);
hasher.update(pk);
let arr = hasher.finalize();
let myso_address_string = hex::encode(arr);
```

## Displaying addresses

MySo supports both addresses with and without a `0x` prefix. MySo recommends that you always include the `0x` prefix in API calls and when you display user addresses.

## Track balance changes for an address

You can track balance changes by calling `suix_getBalance` at predefined intervals. This call returns the total balance for an address. The total includes any coin or token type, but this document focuses on MYSO. You can track changes in the total balance for an address between subsequent `suix_getBalance` requests.

The following bash example demonstrates how to use `suix_getBalance` for address `0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3`. If you use a network other than Devnet, replace the value for `rpc` with the URL to the appropriate full node.

```sh
rpc="https://fullnode.devnet.mysocial.network:443"
address="0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3"
data="{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"suix_getBalance\", \"id\": 1, \"params\": {\"owner\": \"$owner\"}}"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data-raw "$data" $rpc
```

The response is a JSON object that includes the `totalBalance` for the address:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "result":{
     "coinType":"0x2::myso::MYSO",
     "coinObjectCount":40,
     "totalBalance":10000000000,
     "lockedBalance":{

     }
  },
  "id":1
}
```

The following example demonstrates using `suix_getBalance` in Rust:
```rust
use std::str::FromStr;
use myso_sdk::types::base_types::MySoAddress;
use myso_sdk::{SuiClient, SuiClientBuilder};


#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
   let myso = "MySo" SuiClientBuilder::default().build(
      "https://fullnode.devnet.mysocial.network:443",
   ).await.unwrap();
   let address = MySoAddress::from_str("0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3")?;
   let objects = myso.read_api().get_balance(address).await?;
   println!("{:?}", objects);
   Ok(())
}
```

## Use events to track balance changes for an address

You can also track the balance for an address by subscribing to all of the events emitted from it. Use a filter to include only the events related to MYSO coins, such as when the address acquires a coin or pays for a gas fee.
The following example demonstrates how to filter events for an address using bash and cURL:

```sh
rpc="https://fullnode.devnet.mysocial.network:443"
address="0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3"
data="{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\":1, \"method\": \"myso_getEvents\", \"params\": [{\"Recipient\": {\"AddressOwner\": \"0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3\"}}, null, null, true ]}"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data-raw "$data" $rpc
```

The response can include a large number of events. Add pagination to the response using the `nextCursor` key in the request. You can determine the corresponding `txDigest` and `eventSeq` from the `id` field of a transaction.

You can replace the first `null` in the `params` array with a `txDigest` value to paginate from a specific point. The second `null` is an integer that defines how many results (up to 1000) to return and the `true` means ascending order. You can use the `nextCursor` so the response starts from a desired point.

The `id` field of any transaction looks like:

```sh
"id": {
    "txDigest": "GZQN9pE3Zr9ZfLzBK1BfVCXtbjx5xKMxPSEKaHDvL3E2",
    "eventSeq": 6019
}
```

With this data, create a `nextCursor` as follows:

```sh
nextCursor : {"txDigest": "GZQN9pE3Zr9ZfLzBK1BfVCXtbjx5xKMxPSEKaHDvL3E2","eventSeq": 6019}
```

## Blocks vs checkpoints

MySo is a DAG-based blockchain and uses checkpoints for node synchronization and global transaction ordering. Checkpoints differ from blocks in the following ways:
 - MySo creates checkpoints and adds finalized transactions. Note that transactions are finalized even before they are included in a checkpoint
 - Checkpoints do not fork, roll back, or reorganize.
 - MySo creates about four checkpoints every second. Find the most up-to-date statistic on the [MySo public dashboard](https://metrics.mysocial.network/public-dashboards/4ceb11cc210d4025b122294586961169).

### Checkpoint API operations

MySo Checkpoint API operations include:
 - [`myso_getCheckpoint`](/myso-api-ref#myso_getCheckpoint): Retrieves the specified checkpoint.
 - [`myso_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber`](/myso-api-ref#myso_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber): Retrieves the sequence number of the most recently executed checkpoint.
 - [`myso_getCheckpoints`](/myso-api-ref#myso_getCheckpoints): Retrieves a paginated list of checkpoints that occurred during the specified interval. Pending a future release.

## MYSO balance transfer

To transfer a specific amount of MYSO between addresses, you need a MYSO token object with that specific value. InMySo, everything is an object, including MYSO tokens. The amount of MYSO in each MYSO token object varies. For example, an address could own 3 MYSO tokens with different values: one of 0.1 MYSO, a second of 1.0 MYSO, and a third with 0.005 MYSO. The total balance for the address equals the sum of the values of the individual MYSO token objects, in this case, 1.105 MYSO.

You can merge and split MYSO token objects to create token objects with specific values. To create a MYSO token worth .6 MYSO, split the token worth 1 MYSO into two token objects worth .6 MYSO and .4 MYSO.

To transfer a specific amount of MYSO, you need a MYSO token worth that specific amount. To get a MYSO token with that specific value, you might need to split or merge existing MYSO tokens. MySo supports several methods to accomplish this, including some that do not require you to manually split or merge coins.

## MySo API operations for transfers

MySo supports the following API operations related to transferring MYSO between addresses:

 - [`myso_transferObject`](/myso-api-ref#myso_transferObject): Because MYSO tokens are objects, you can transfer MYSO tokens just like any other object. This method requires a gas token, and is useful in niche cases only.

 - [`myso_payAllSui`](/myso-api-ref#myso_payAllSui): This method accepts an array of MYSO token IDs. It merges all existing tokens into one, deducts the gas fee, then sends the merged token to the recipient address.

   The method is especially useful if you want to transfer all MYSO from an address. To merge together all coins for an address, set the recipient as the same address. This is a native MySo method and does not produce additional on-chain transaction objects for the internal merge operation.

 - [`myso_paySui`](/myso-api-ref#myso_paySui): This operation accepts an array of MYSO token IDs, an array of amounts, and an array of recipient addresses.

   The amounts and recipients array map one to one. Even if you use only one recipient address, you must include it for each amount in the amount array.

   The operation merges all of the tokens provided into one token object and settles the gas fees. It then splits the token according to the amounts in the amounts array and sends the first token to the first recipient, the second token to the second recipient, and so on. Any remaining MYSO on the token stays in the source address.

   The benefits of this method include: no gas fees for merging or splitting tokens, and the abstracted token merge and split. The `myso_paySui` operation is a native function, so the merge and split operations are not considered MySo transactions. The gas fees for them match typical transactions on MySo.You can use this operation to split coins in your own address by setting the recipient as your own address. Note that the total value of the input coins must be greater than the total value of the amounts to send.

 - [`myso_pay`](/myso-api-ref#myso_pay): This method is similar to myso_paySui, but it accepts any kind of coin or token instead of only MYSO. You must include a gas token, and all of the coins or tokens must be the same type.

 - [`myso_transferSui`](/myso-api-ref#myso_transferSui): This method accepts only one MYSO token object and an amount to send to the recipient. It uses the same token for gas fees, so the amount to transfer must be strictly less than the value of the MYSO token used.

## Signing transactions

Refer to [MySo Signatures](/concepts/transactions/transaction-auth.mdx) for more details on signature validity requirements.

## MYSO staking

The MySo blockchain uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake mechanism (DPoS). This allows MYSO token holders to stake their MYSO tokens to any validator of their choice. When someone stakes their MYSO tokens, it means those tokens are locked for the entire epoch. Users can withdraw their stake at any time, but new staking requests become active only at the start of the next epoch.

MYSO holders who stake their tokens to validators earn rewards for helping secure the MySo network. MySo determines rewards for staking based on stake rewards on the network, and distributes them at the end of each epoch.

The total voting power in the MySo Network is always 10,000. The voting power of each individual validator is similar to basis points. For example, a voting power of 101 = 1.01%.MySo's quorum threshold (number of votes needed to confirm a transaction) is 6,667 (which is greater than 2/3). The voting power for a single validator is capped at 1,000 (10%) regardless of how much stake the validator has.

## Staking functions

MySo supports the following API operations related to staking. You can find the source code in the [myso_system](https://github.com/the-social-proof-foundation/myso-core/blob/main/crates/myso-framework/packages/myso-system/sources/myso_system.move) module.

 - `request_add_stake`: Add user stake to a validator's staking pool.

   ```move
   public fun request_add_stake(
      self: &mut SuiSystemState,
      stake: Coin<MYSO>,
      validator_address: address,
      ctx: &mut TxContext,
   ) {
      validator_set::request_add_stake(
         &mut self.validators,
         validator_address,
         coin::into_balance(stake),
         option::none(),
         ctx,
      );
   }
   ```

 - `request_add_stake_mul_coin`: Add user stake to a validator's staking pool using multiple coins.

   ```move
   public fun request_add_stake_mul_coin(
      self: &mut SuiSystemState,
      delegate_stakes: vector<Coin<MYSO>>,
      stake_amount: option::Option<u64>,
      validator_address: address,
      ctx: &mut TxContext,
   ) {
      let balance = extract_coin_balance(delegate_stakes, stake_amount, ctx);
      validator_set::request_add_stake(&mut self.validators, validator_address, balance, option::none(), ctx);
   }
   ```

 - `request_add_stake_with_locked_coin`: Add user stake to a validator's staking pool using a locked MYSO coin.

   ```move
   public fun request_add_stake_with_locked_coin(
      self: &mut SuiSystemState,
      stake: LockedCoin<MYSO>,
      validator_address: address,
      ctx: &mut TxContext,
   ) {
      let (balance, lock) = locked_coin::into_balance(stake);
      validator_set::request_add_stake(&mut self.validators, validator_address, balance, option::some(lock), ctx);
   }
   ```

 - `request_withdraw_stake`: Withdraw some portion of a user stake from a validator's staking pool.

   ```move
   public fun request_withdraw_stake(
      self: &mut SuiSystemState,
      delegation: &mut Delegation,
      staked_sui: &mut StakedSui,
      principal_withdraw_amount: u64,
      ctx: &mut TxContext,
   ) {
      validator_set::request_withdraw_stake(
         &mut self.validators,
         delegation,
         staked_sui,
         principal_withdraw_amount,
         ctx,
      );
   }
   ```
