To perform transactions on a MySo network, you need MYSO tokens to pay for gas and storage. 

For applications on Mainnet, you must buy real MYSO on exchanges like Coinbase, OKX, or Robinhood. Its value is determined by market factors such as supply and demand, network utility, and perceived value.

Because Mainnet tokens cost real money, development can be expensive. That's why MySo provides Devnet and Testnet networks, which mirror Mainnet features and enable you to build and test safely for an affordable cost.

:::important

MYSO tokens on Devnet and Testnet are free and hold no monetary value.

:::

You can get free MYSO tokens from the MySo faucet, which lets you deploy and interact with smart contracts and objects on Devnet, Testnet, or a local network. There is no faucet for Mainnet.

Create MySo account and setup CLI environment.

</summary>

```sh
$ myso client
```

If this is the first time running the `myso client` CLI tool, it asks you to provide a MySo full node server URL (or press enter for the default Testnet), select an encryption scheme to generate an address, and stores the configuration in a `client.yaml` file. For more information, refer to the [MySo client CLI tutorial](/references/cli/client.mdx).

If this is not your first time running `myso client`, then you already have a `client.yaml` file in your local environment. If you'd like to create a new address for this tutorial, use the command:

```sh 
$ myso client new-address ed25519
```

## Request MYSO tokens from faucet {#online-faucet}

Visit the online faucet to request MYSO tokens: https://faucet.mysocial.network/

Then, follow these steps: 

1. Connect your wallet or paste your wallet address in the address field. Get your wallet address in the CLI with the command `myso client active-address`. 
1. Use the network dropdown to select the correct network: Testnet, Devnet, or Localnet. It is recommended to use the Testnet for most use cases before deploying to Mainnet for production. [Learn more](/guides/developer/getting-started/configure-myso-client.mdx) about the available networks and their differences. 
1. Click the **Request MYSO** button. 

To request more MYSO, refresh your browser and click the **Request MYSO** button again. The requests are rate limited, however, so too many requests results in a waiting period before you are able to request more tokens.

### Community faucets 

You can also use the following community-provided faucets to obtain MYSO tokens:

- http://faucet.n1stake.com/

- http://faucet.suilearn.io/

These faucets have their own separate limits, such as one request per day or one request every few hours.

### Verify token balance 

To check your balance of MYSO tokens and confirm you received some from the faucet, use the command:

```
$ myso client balance 
```

Alternatively, use a MySo Explorer such as [MySoVision](https://suivision.xyz/) or [MySoScan](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/accounts) to check the MYSO token balance of an address.

You should have a balance of MYSO tokens:

```
╭────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Balance of coins owned by this address     │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ╭────────────────────────────────────────╮ │
│ │ coin       balance (raw)  balance      │ │
│ ├────────────────────────────────────────┤ │
│ │ MySo        56804696124     0.50 MYSO    │ │
│ ╰────────────────────────────────────────╯ │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

If you do not have a balance, repeat the [request MYSO tokens from faucet](#online-faucet) steps, or use an [alternative faucet method](#alternative-faucets).

### Return unused Testnet MYSO

The faucet drains from a finite pool of MYSO. If the pool empties, it disrupts faucet service for the rest of the community. To help ensure this doesn't happen, you can use the online faucet to return your unused MYSO to the Testnet pool. You cannot return MYSO to the Devnet or Localnet pools.

There are two ways to return unused Testnet MYSO tokens:

- Connect your wallet to the online faucet, and click the **Return tokens to faucet** button. Approve the transaction using your wallet and your MYSO tokens are returned to the pool.

- If you prefer not to connect your wallet, send the tokens to the address `0x7a9d19d4c210663926eb549da59a54e25777fef63161bfccda08277b58b4212e` via a [separate transaction](/guides/developer/transactions/sign-and-send-txn.mdx).

## Alternative methods for getting MYSO tokens {#alternative-faucets}

If you need an alternative method to get MYSO tokens for deployment on Testnet or Devnet, you have several options.

:::tip

Every method to obtain MYSO tokens for Testnet and Devnet is rate limited. If you need a large amount of MYSO tokens, use a local network.

<TabItem value="discord" label="Discord">

1. Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/myso).
   
   If you try to join the MySo Discord channel using a newly created Discord account, you might need to wait a few days for validation.
1. Request MYSO tokens in the MySo [#devnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) or [#testnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) Discord channels. Send the following message to the channel, replacing `<YOUR MYSO ADDRESS>` with your client address:
   ```sh
   !faucet <YOUR MYSO ADDRESS>
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

Use the following cURL commands to set console variables and request tokens directly from the faucet server. Set `NETWORK` to either `testnet` or `devnet`.

```sh
$ ADDRESS=$(myso client active-address)
$ NETWORK=testnet
$ curl --location --request POST "https://faucet.${NETWORK}.mysocial.network/v2/gas" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw "{
    \"FixedAmountRequest\": {
        \"recipient\": \"${ADDRESS}\"
    }
}"
```

If you're working with a local network, replace `"https://faucet.${NETWORK}.mysocial.network/v2/gas"` with the appropriate value based on which package runs your network:

- `myso-faucet`: `http://127.0.0.1:5003/gas`
- `myso`: `http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript SDK">

You can access the faucet using the [MySo TypeScript SDK](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript).

```typescript
import { getFaucetHost, requestMySoFromFaucetV2 } from '@socialproof/myso/faucet';

// get tokens from the Devnet faucet server
await requestMySoFromFaucetV2({
	// connect to Devnet
	host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
	recipient: '<YOUR MYSO ADDRESS>',
});
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## MYSO tokens on a local network

If you are running a local MySo network, you can get MYSO tokens from your local faucet. See the [Connect to a Local Network](/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet) topic for details.
