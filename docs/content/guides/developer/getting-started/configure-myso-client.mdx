The MySo client configuration specifies which network to connect to and which address to send transactions.

<Tabs className="tabsHeadingCentered--small">
<TabItem value="prereq" label="Prerequisites">

First, confirm that MySo has been installed successfully:

```
$ myso --version
```

If this command returns `myso not found`, then MySo is not installed and you must [follow the installation instructions](/guides/developer/getting-started/myso-install.mdx).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## `myso client`

Run the MySo CLI with the command:

```
$ myso client
```

:::info

If a previous MySo installation stored a `client.yaml` file locally, you will receive the `myso client --help` output in the console. You can delete the existing `~/.myso/myso_config/client.yaml` file if you'd like to start fresh, or you can continue using the existing configuration.

:::

The prompt asks if you want to create the `client.yaml` file, select `Y` or press enter. You can skip the prompt with `myso client -y`.

```
No myso config found in `~/.myso/myso_config/client.yaml`, create one [Y/n]?
```

You will see the following output:

```
Generated new keypair ...
  secret recovery phrase : [recovery phrase words are here]
Created "~/.myso/myso_config/client.yaml"
Set active environment to testnet
```

:::caution

Store recovery phrases securely and do not share them with anyone, as they provide access to any objects and tokens that an address owns.

It will not be visible again once the CLI history disappears.

## `client.yaml`

Your MySo client is now configured. By default, MySo stores this information in either the `~/.myso/myso_config/client.yaml` file (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.myso\myso_config\client.yaml` file (Windows). You can store a `client.yaml` file in a different location, if preferred, and specify its location with the `--client.config` flag.

The `client.yaml` contains the configuration for connecting to different MySo networks (Testnet, Mainnet, Devnet, and Localnet), as well as your current active environment, which tells the CLI which network to use when you don't explicitly specify one.

You can modify your configuration using the `myso client` subcommands. See the output of `myso client --help` for more information.

MySo stores the key for the MySo address in a separate file, `~/.myso/myso_config/myso.keystore` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE/.myso/myso_config/myso.keystore` (Windows). Learn more about MySo addresses in [Create a MySo Address](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-address.mdx).
