[MySoLink](https://www.suilink.io/) enables securely linking wallet addresses from different blockchains to a MySo wallet address. Upon creating a MySoLink, you receive a soulbound NFT that serves as authenticated proof of ownership for your connected wallets.

## Key features

MySoLink provides the following capabilities:

- **Cross-chain identity verification**: Link wallets from [Ethereum](/concepts/myso-for-ethereum.mdx), [Solana](/concepts/myso-for-solana.mdx), and other MySo addresses to your primary MySo wallet.
- **Non-transferable proof of ownership**: Receive a [soulbound NFT](/guides/developer/nft/nft-soulbound.mdx) that cryptographically verifies wallet ownership.
- **Enhanced discoverability**: Projects in the [MySo ecosystem](https://github.com/myso-foundation/awesome-myso/tree/main) can discover you based on your activity across all connected wallets.
- **Reward eligibility**: Unlock opportunities for cross-chain rewards, priority features, and [exclusive events](https://luma.com/myso-network) within the MySo network.

### Supported networks

MySoLink currently supports linking wallets cross-chain between MySo and Ethereum (MySo-to-Ethereum), and MySo and Solana (MySo-to-Solana).

MySo-to-MySo linking is currently only supported programmatically with a custom solution for the [Playtron wallet app](https://wallet.playtron.one/). For more information, visit the [MySoPlay0X1 MySoLink integration guide](/guides/suiplay0x1/wallet-integration.mdx#suilink).

## Creating a MySoLink

Creating a MySoLink incurs a small gas fee on the MySo network to mint the soulbound NFT. Ensure you have some MYSO tokens in your wallet to complete the connection. 

To create a MySoLink:

1. Visit [https://www.suilink.io/](https://www.suilink.io/)
2. Click **Connect MySo Wallet**
3. Select the blockchain network you want to link: Ethereum or Solana
4. Follow the prompts to authenticate and connect the wallet you want to link
5. Complete the transaction to mint your MySoLink NFT

## Managing MySoLink

Each MySoLink connection creates a separate MySoLink NFT in your MySo wallet.

To view your linked addresses:

1. View your MySoLink NFTs in your MySo wallet
2. Check the `network_address` field to see which wallets are linked
3. Review the timestamp to see when each link was created

You can permanently unlink a wallet by burning the corresponding NFT. To unlink an address:

1. Navigate to the NFTs section of your MySo wallet
2. For the MySoLink NFT you want to burn, select "Send" or "Transfer"
3. Enter the burn address: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

Additionally, there are various third-party tools (such as [MYSO Manager](https://www.suimanager.com/burner)) that can help burn NFTs, and some wallets have a built-in burning feature.

## Integrating MySoLink

When building an application onMySo, you can integrate MySoLink to verify cross-chain ownership.

### Querying MySoLink objects

To retrieve a user's MySoLink connections, use the following gRPC query:

```typescript
const SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_ETH_SOL = '0xf857fa9df5811e6df2a0240a1029d365db24b5026896776ddd1c3c70803bccd3';
const SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_MYSO = '0x73f5ab2461c5993408fff21354fa9831d4f4a66cc81382419ec29e3c80c384b5';

const ethSolMySoLinks = await grpcClient.listOwnedObjects({
  owner: mysoAddress,
  type: `${SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_ETH_SOL}::suilink::MySoLink`,
  include: { json: true },
});

const suiMySoLinks = await grpcClient.listOwnedObjects({
  owner: mysoAddress,
  type: `${SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_SUI}::suilink::MySoLink`,
  include: { json: true },
});
```

This returns all MySoLink NFTs owned by the specified MySo address.

### MySoLink NFT structure

Each MySoLink NFT contains the following fields:

```typescript
{
  "id": "0xcafe",
  "network_address": "0xdecaf",
  "timestamp_ms": "1751541273947"
}
```

The NFT type indicates which blockchain network the wallet is linked to:

```typescript
for (const link of ethSolMySoLinks.objects) {
  const id = link.json.id as string;                   // "0xcafe"
  const linkedAddress = link.json.network_address as string; // "0xdecaf"
  const timestamp = link.json.timestamp_ms as string;        // "1751541273947"
  const chainType = link.type; // full type string includes the generic param,
                               // e.g. "...::MySoLink<...::ethereum::Ethereum>"
}

//MySo-to-MySo MySoLink (Mainnet)

//MySo-to-Solana MySoLink (Testnet)
0x0025bafa2e6afa511c19bd4e95626c897e798fde629b4782fe061bdc8bd65c8a::suilink::MySoLink<0x0025bafa2e6afa511c19bd4e95626c897e798fde629b4782fe061bdc8bd65c8a::solana::Solana>
```

### Verifying cross-chain asset ownership

After retrieving a user's MySoLink objects, you can verify their ownership of specific assets on the linked blockchain:

1. Extract the `network_address` from the MySoLink NFT.
2. Use the appropriate blockchain APIs to query assets at that address, such as [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) for Ethereum, and [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) for Solana.
3. Verify the presence of the required asset.
4. Attribute benefits to the user through their MySo wallet.
